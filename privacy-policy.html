TrackMyPlay Privacy Policy

Last updated: August 1, 2025

1. Developer Information
TrackMyPlay is developed and maintained by [Your Name or Company], located at [Your Address]. Contact: privacy@trackmyplay.com

2. Data Collection
TrackMyPlay does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. We do not use analytics tools or third-party SDKs.

3. Audio Processing
The app uses on-device audio recognition to detect instrument playing. All processing happens locally on your device. No recordings or raw audio are stored or shared.

4. Local Storage
The app stores practice metadata locally—session durations, instrument calibration, app preferences. This data never leaves your device and is permanently deleted when the app is uninstalled.

5. Sharing Data with Third Parties
We do not integrate with third-party services or share any data.

6. User Rights
Because no personal data is collected or transmitted, there is no user data to delete or withdraw consent. Uninstalling the app deletes all local data.

7. Policy Updates
We may update this policy occasionally. We will clearly note the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.

8. Contact
For questions about this policy, please email: privacy@trackmyplay.com
